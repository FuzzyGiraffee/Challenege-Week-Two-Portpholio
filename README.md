## Features

My Portpholio website is comprised of HTML and CSS, with annotations that when clicked automatically scroll the webpage to the corresponding section. The images in the portpholio section also link to the corresponding webpages if they exist, and automatically resize to fit the webpage when it is viewed on mobile devices. Various other elements of the UI also adjust such as the navigation bar and contact information at the bottom of the webpage.
